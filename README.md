# Kinematic control of Agata mobile robot to follow a line simulation using V-REP
  Project repository for the PDE4426 Mobile robotics. 
  In this project a line following robot have been implemented in **V-REP**. 
  The code is written in **python** and utilizes **V-REPs remote API**.
  
  Following are the softwares and files necessary to run the simulation is included in this repo given the following prerequisites are met.
  1. A valid installation of V-REP. Available at http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html
  2. A version of Python 3. Available at https://www.python.org/
  
  To run the code the following libraries required:
  - Pillow 
  - matplotlib 
  - numpy
  
  ***Note: If you install a version of the Spyder python editor (for instance via Anaconda 3) all of the libraries are included.***
  
To run the code the following steps must be taken.

1. Open Agata.ttt in V-REP 
    - Start the simulation
2. Run **diffDrive.py** in the way you are able to run Python 3 scripts.

**diffDrive.py** is stopped once the simulation is terminated in V-REP.
